adding a reverse proxy at the application tier just before the database tier can help in data security of a fintech app in a few ways:

- Increased security: A reverse proxy can help to increase the security of a fintech app by acting as a firewall between the app and the database. This can help to protect 
                    the database from unauthorized access and attacks.
- Improved performance: A reverse proxy can also help to improve the performance of a fintech app by caching frequently accessed pages and resources. This can help to 
                        reduce the load on the database and improve the overall performance of the app.
- Centralized logging: A reverse proxy can also help to centralize logging for a fintech app. This can make it easier to troubleshoot problems and identify security threats.
- Load balancing: A reverse proxy can also help to load balance a fintech app. This can help to improve the performance of the app by distributing 
                  traffic across multiple servers.

Here are some specific examples of how a reverse proxy can help to improve data security in a fintech app:
- A reverse proxy can be used to filter traffic based on IP addresses or user agents. This can help to prevent unauthorized access to the database.
- A reverse proxy can be used to encrypt traffic between the app and the database. This can help to protect the data from being intercepted by unauthorized parties.
- A reverse proxy can be used to enforce security policies, such as requiring users to authenticate before they can access the database.
