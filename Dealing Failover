Redundancy is the duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability. In the context of fintech apps, redundancy can 
be used to help ensure that the app remains available even if one or more components fail.

There are two main types of redundancy: active and passive. Active redundancy involves having two or more identical components that are both operational at the same time. 
If one of the components fails, the other component can take over its function. Passive redundancy involves having one or more spare components that are not operational 
until they are needed. If one of the components fails, the spare component can be brought online to replace it.

There are a number of ways that redundancy can be used to deal with failover in fintech apps. For example, you could:

Use redundant servers:    This means having two or more servers that are running the same application. If one server fails, the other server can take over.
Use redundant databases:  This means having two or more databases that store the same data. If one database fails, the other database can still be accessed.
Use redundant networking: This means having two or more network connections that are used to connect to the app. If one network connection fails, the other network 
                          connection can still be used.
By using redundancy, you can help to ensure that your fintech app remains available even if one or more components fail. This can help to protect your users from 
inconvenience and financial loss.

Here are some additional considerations for using redundancy in fintech apps:

The cost of redundancy:       Redundancy can add to the cost of developing and maintaining a fintech app. However, the cost of redundancy is often outweighed by the 
                              benefits of ensuring that the app remains available.
The complexity of redundancy: Redundancy can add to the complexity of a fintech app. It is important to carefully design the redundancy so that it does not introduce new 
                              vulnerabilities.
The importance of testing:    It is important to test the redundancy of a fintech app to ensure that it works as expected. This testing should be done regularly to ensure 
                              that the redundancy remains effective.
By following these considerations, you can help to ensure that the redundancy in your fintech app is effective and does not introduce new vulnerabilities.
