The POS terminal is the physical device that the merchant uses to process payments. It is typically a touchscreen device that allows the merchant to enter the customer's 
payment information. The POS terminal then communicates with the payment processing app to initiate the payment.

Once the payment is initiated, the POS terminal will send the customer's payment information to the payment processing app. The payment processing app will then verify the 
customer's payment information and authorize the payment. If the payment is authorized, the payment processing app will send a message to the POS terminal to indicate that 
the payment has been successful.

The POS terminal will then display a message to the customer indicating that the payment has been successful. The POS terminal will also print a receipt for the customer.

The role of the POS terminal in a fintech app is to provide a secure and convenient way for merchants to process payments. The POS terminal helps to protect the customer's 
payment information by encrypting the information before it is transmitted to the payment processing app. The POS terminal also helps to verify the customer's payment 
information to ensure that the payment is authorized.

Here are some specific examples of how the POS terminal interacts with the payment processing app:

Encryption:    The POS terminal will encrypt the customer's payment information before it is transmitted to the payment processing app. This helps to protect the 
               information from being intercepted by unauthorized parties.
Verification:  The payment processing app will verify the customer's payment information to ensure that the payment is authorized. This helps to protect the merchant from 
               fraudulent payments.
Authorization: Once the customer's payment information has been verified, the payment processing app will authorize the payment. This means that the merchant will be able 
               to collect the payment from the customer.
Receipt:       The POS terminal will print a receipt for the customer. This receipt will include the amount of the payment, the date and time of the payment, and the 
               merchant's information.

By interacting with the payment processing app in these ways, the POS terminal helps to ensure that payments are processed securely and conveniently.
